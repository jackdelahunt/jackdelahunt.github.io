  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    Graduated in Applied Computing (Game Development) from The Waterford Institute of Technology (SETU) in Ireland. Worked for Red Hat as an intern and full time for some time. 
    <br> 
    Now living in the UK to try something new. I have been programming for half my life and have many areas that excite me. I enjoy writing low level and performance critical code.
    <br> 
    I have listed some projects showcasing some explorations I have done in this area in the form of Games/Game Engines. I also have an interest in programming language creation, linked below.
    <br> <br>
    Please get in contact for things such as hiring opportunities or just find the things I have done interesting and want to talk about them.

  <h2>Notable projects</h2>

  <h3>3D voxel mesh editor - <a href="https://github.com/jackdelahunt/game-prototypes/releases/tag/game9-v1">Download</a> <a href="https://github.com/jackdelahunt/game-prototypes/tree/main/game9">Repo</a> </h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Handmade 3D game engine in C++</li>
        <li>OpenGL renderer using defered rendering with multiple render passes for geometry, lighting, shadows and screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO)</li>
        <li>Using Phong lighting for a mix of ambient, diffuse and specular lighting effects</li>
        <li>Shadows are acheived by shadow mapping, the geometry is rendered from the sun's position which gives positional data of each fragment relative to the sun</li>
        <li>SSAO is two steps, the first using the geometry pass output data to find areas to occlude and output to a texture</li>
        <li>The SSAO is then blurred to reduce artifacts and noise</li>
        <li>The lighting pass then combines the scenes albedo, lighting and SSAO</li>
        <li>A final post processig step is applied for gamma correction</li>
        <li>A voxel mesh is dynamically updated by user provided tools for editing the mesh geometry and colours</li>
        <li>A mesh can also be generated by the use of noise with many options to create unique structures</li>
        <li>Tools for loading and saving a mesh is provided and the base game comes with an example on startup</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>2D dynamic lighting demo - <a href="https://github.com/jackdelahunt/game-prototypes/releases/tag/game8-v1">Download</a> <a href="https://github.com/jackdelahunt/game-prototypes/tree/main/game8">Repo</a> </h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Handmade 2D game engine in C++</li>
        <li>OpenGL renderer with three render passes</li>
        <li>First render pass to draw unlit scene, colour, depth, normal and water buffers are filled from this pass</li>
        <li>Second render pass to add screen space lighting, sampling from the normal buffer gives the lighting a more 3D look</li>
        <li>Third render pass is for water reflection, lit scene is sampled and reflections are filled in based on fragment position</li>
        <li>Animated textures for the bat, <a href="https://github.com/jackdelahunt/game-prototypes/releases/tag/game8-v1">download</a> and run to see</li>
        <li>Once loaded, albedo and normal textures are packed into an atlas before being sent to GPU</li>
        <li>I am not an artist so the assets are sourced from <a href="https://szadiart.itch.io/pixel-fantasy-caves">here</a>, however all normal maps were added by hand</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Handmade 2D game engine in C++</li>
        <li>OpenGL renderer with multiple render passes</li>
        <li>First render pass to draw unlit scene with colour and depth information</li>
        <li>Second render pass to add screen space lighting, both global lighting and point lights</li>
        <li>Third render pass for post-processing effects, like blur on depth information and vignette</li>
        <li>Particle effects for falling leaves</li>
        <li>Animated textures for lamps and smoke, <a href="https://github.com/jackdelahunt/game-prototypes/releases/tag/game7-v1">download</a> and run to see</li>
        <li>Once loaded textures are packed into an atlas before being sent to GPU</li>

        <li>I am not an artist so the assets are sourced from <a href="https://brullov.itch.io/oak-woods">here</a>, I did some tweaking like added animations for lamps and expanding the animation on the shop</li>
